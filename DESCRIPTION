Description: An implementation of a specific method for generating
    n-dimensional random vectors with given marginal distributions and
    correlation matrix. The method uses the NORTA (NORmal To Anything)
    approach which generates a standard normal random vector and then
    transforms it into a random vector with specified marginal distributions
    and the RA (Retrospective Approximation) algorithm which is a generic
    stochastic root-finding algorithm. The marginals can be continuous or
    discrete. See the vignette of package for more details.
